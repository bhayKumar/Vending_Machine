# Vending_Machine
This project is a simple Vending Machine Simulator made using C++. It shows how real vending machines work, like selecting items, handling payments, giving change, and showing errors if something goes wrong. The program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes and functions to keep the code clean and well-organized. It has a menu that lets users easily interact with the machine through the console. The project also checks for invalid inputs to avoid crashes or wrong operations. This is a good example of how OOP can be used to build real-life projects in C++. In the future, more features like better user interface, more payment options, and admin controls for managing items and coins can be added.
